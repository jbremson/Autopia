<h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>
The goal of Autopia is to illuminate the interactions that can be expected
in an alternative fuel/vehicle transition over 40-50 years. Players take
the roles of Consumers, Vehicle Producers and Fuel Producers. Each player
seeks to survive by remainining solvent in the face of regulatory, environmental
and historical change.
</p>


<a name="play">
<h2>Play</h2>
</a>
<p>
Play is conducted by the players interacting with each other in physical space
(i.e. non-virtual). Players negotiate with each other in order to advance
their goals. Consumers seek to own an adequate number of vehicles of the
appropriate feature level. Vehicle and fuel producers seek to maximize their
profits while meeting regulations and mandates. Based on these negotiations
players enter their decisions for the following
turn into a web browser interface where they are then used to calculate the
next step of the model.</p>

<p>
The turn begins with players receiving income for purchasing vehicles and fuel.
Each consumer has a set of goals for the quantity of vehicle he should own and
the feature levels of those vehicles. The consumer purchases cars designed by
the Vehicle Producers to meet their goals. The consumer who first meets his
points goal wins the consumer section of the game. Play ends on the turn when the
    first consumer or consumers meet their goal. The winners of the fuel and vehicle
    producer category are determined by the return that they have managed on their
    initial capital.

    The vehicle purchase screen for the consumer is shown above. The consumer's budget is

<h3>Consumer Home Screen</h3>

<p>
The consumer home screen tracks the consumer's point accumulation progress and fuel expenditures.
</p>

Each vehicle the consumer purchases will increment his scores for <i>Vehicles Purchased</i>,<i>Style</i> and
<i>Performance</i>. The <i>MPG</i> score is the fleet average mpg goal for that consumer. Since a purchased
vehicle remains in the consumer's fleet until it wears out (as long as 8 turns, or up to 30 years), consumers
must make sure they are making satisfactory progress towards their goal on each turn.

<table class="con_home.png">

       <caption align="bottom">Consumer Home Screen</caption>

       <tr><td><img src="con_home.png"></td></tr>



   </table>

 <p>
Above is a simple example consumer home screen. This screen shows a consumer who has purchased
a total of 50 vehicles. The vehicles purchased had 4 style points and 3 performance points. Thus
he has earned 50  points in the vehicle column, 200 points (50 vehicles x 4 points) in Style and
150 points (50 vehicles x 3 points) in Performance. His fleet mpg goal is 38.0 mpg and his actual
fleet mpg 29.5 (see Vehicle Stat table).
                                          </p>
<p>
The <i>Vehicle Stats</i>table provides information on the <i>expected</i>fuel consumption for
the consumer <i>on the following turn. The price of fuel on the next turn is predicted using
the current fuel price. Players can look at the <i>Fuel Info</i> page to make their own predictions
    about the fuel price trends. The fuel expenditure will be deducted from the allowance given to
the consumer at the start of the turn.</i>.

<h3>Consumer Tools</h3>

    The consumer can inspect the make up of his fleet using the <i>My Fleet</i> link

<h2>Vehicle Producer Game Guide</h2>

<p>
    The vehicle producer's game goal is to maximize his profitability. The vehicle
    producer can sell up to 5 different vehicle types. During play the vehicle producer
    meets with consumer players so that he can design vehicles that are attractive to them.
    Each turn the vehicle producer accumulates R&D points that uses to refine his technology.
    R&D can be used to improve his drivetrain technology and the style and performance
    of his vehicle offerings.


</p>

<a name="veh_create"></a>
<h3>Creating a Vehicle</h3>

<p>
The vehicle producer has two main concerns: creating vehicles that will be successful in the
market and meeting any government regulations and mandates. The producer can learn what the
market desires by interacting with consumers. Consumers will have vehicle budgets and desires
for certain levels of performance, style and fuel efficiency. Furthermore, the producer
must estimate how many vehicles he believes he can sell. Larger vehicle runs reduce costs,
but over-estimating sales and falling short can result in substantial penalties, depending on by how much
the producer falls short of his sales target.
</p>


<table class="create_veh_1.png">

       <caption align="bottom">Sample Basic Create Vehicle Screen</caption>

       <tr><td><img src="create_veh_1.png"></td></tr>



   </table>

<p>
Above is a create vehicle screen for the most basic vehicle possible in the game.
The basic vehicle is a midsized, four cylinder, standard gasoline powered sedan
similar to the Toyota Camry. The attributes are set as follows:


<ul>
<li>Drivetrain: <br>
    <p>
    A choice of 12 <a href="#drivetrain">drivetrains.</a> Drivetrain effects mpg and price
    of the the vehicle.
    </p>

</li>
<li>Style: <br>
    <p>
    An aggregate value describing the vehicle size, level of amenities and the appearance of
    the vehicle. The style level of the vehicle impacts its fuel economy. Increasing the style
    increases mpg, decreasing it does the opposite.
    </p>


</li>

<li>Performance: <br>
    <p>
    Vehicle power measurement. Each step corresponds to a 1 mpg change in fuel economy.
      </p>
</li>

<li>Total: <br>
    <p>The dropdown menu represents the run size for the vehicle. The lower level is the minimum
    number of vehicles that must be sold in order to avoid a penalty. The upper number is the
    maximum number that can be produced. The penalty formula is: </p>

    <div style="margin-left:100px">penalty = (min level - vehicles sold) * vehicle cost * 4</div>

    <p> For example if the producer specified a run of 400-1000 his <i>min level</i> would be 400
        vehicles. If he only sold 390 he would be penalized:</p>

    <div style="margin-left:100px">penalty = (400-390) * 21649 * 4 =~ 866,000</div>

    <p>

        This increases the actual production cost of the 390 vehicles sold to ~ 23,900, from 21,649.
        Given a competitive market for the vehicle the producer will likely see a negative margin for
        each vehicle sold. The penalty can be severe given a large shortfall. Producers should be careful in their market size estimation for
    a vehicle and then make sure they get close to their target, even if the vehicle must be
    sold below cost.  </p>

    <p>The cost and mpg columns show the final cost and mpg for the vehicle after production run, style and
    performance have been accounted for.</p>


</li>


<li> Name:<br>

    <p>
        The vehicle name.

    </p>




</li>

    <li>Set Margin: (not shown in picture)<br>

        <p>
            Allows the consumer to set a price using a percentage margin. The price can be still be set manually.


        </p>



    </li>

<li>

    Price:<br>

    <p>

        Sales price of the vehicle. This can be altered at any time.
    </p>

</li>


    <li>Submit:<br>

        <p>Submit the vehicle for release on the next turn. This decision is irrevocable once made.</p>

    </li>
